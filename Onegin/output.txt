     Friend of my heart, be at my side,
     Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
     Friends, all this meant was: I've a date
     Friends, how my heart would leap with pleasure
     friends, recollect how I surrendered
     Friendship, as I must own to you,
     From all sweet things that gave me pleasure,
     from Boston's cloth or gossip's quote;
     from drowning's death in Lethe river
     From early on she loved romances,
     from German realms of mist and steam,
     from her Monsieur took on the child.
     From here, deep-sunk in pensive woe,
     From his first youth he'd known the force,
     From hour to hour a surer capture
     from Million Street16 came floating round;
     From that rough spell at last exempted,
     from their own country? Then she shot
     From violent passions fast pulsating
     From widow Clicquot and from Moët,
     from young Tatyana's dwelling-place,
     frost gleams. We watch with gleeful thanks
     fruit liqueurs and an Almanack
     Full of obedience and demureness,
     galop, mazurka, waltz... Meanwhile

     good night; I swear I'll lie down soon.''

     he and Onegin start alluding
     He asks. She can't accept. Why ever?
     He could have spoken without harming,
     He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
     He deemed, in general, letters vain,
     He destined Olga's hand for me,
     he doesn't hear when I address
     He drained his glass down to the end
     He finds the shock beyond all bearing:
     He followed them without illusion,
     he found Tatyana so attractive,
     He found them in some old collection,
     He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
     He gave this figure -- loved with passion,
     He gave three balls a year, and rather
     He goes inside, corpse-like of feature...
     He got so used to this immersion,
     He lacked the slightest predilection
     He lay quite still, and strange as dreaming
     He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''4
     He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
     he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
     He nods -- they start to fuss and truckle;
     He opens up a door. What's that
     he read of course the sceptic Bayle15
     He reads to Olga on occasion,
     He rings at once, and what a scurry!
     He roamed the world, his lyre behind him;
     He sang of grief and parting-time,
     He sang of love, to love subjected,
     He saw the sad girl's trembling state,
     He sees: in slush, stretched out and keeping
     He smiled as Lensky talked: the heady
     He sweetened up with fancy's icing
     He thought that Olga'd be confused,
     he turns away: ``I've had enough --
     He wakes -- and who is this who writes him?
     He was a good and simple barin;6
     He was convinced, a kindred creature
     He was no fool; appreciated
     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     He was the slave of a tenacious,
     He was too young to have been blighted
     He was without that dithyrambic
     He who has lived and thought is certain
     He'd brought back all the fruits of learning
     He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
     he'd sack the Muses and get wedded;
     he'd swim this Hellespont; then later
     He's always with her: either seated
     He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating
     he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
     He's gone away and left his village,
     he's got consumption. In his anguish
     He's here -- Monsieur Guillot, my friend.
     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
     He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
     He's off -- this ruthless legislator
     he's put belle Tatiana instead.

     her little friends, Tatyana'd yawn,

     ``How long has he been on the scene?
     How long he'd been here, was her query,
     how long is it?'' ``And since I fed

     How often, with her sweet communion,

     I ask you, each and every poet!
     I buttonhole a wandering neighbour
     I can see naught, as Hymen's foe,
     ``I can't sleep, nyanya: it's so stifling!
     ``I close. I dread to read this page...
     I could describe here his attire;
     I count each hour the whole day through;
     I do, I do. Well, where's he gone?''
     I don't know why, but for my friend
     I don't mean that she never shivered,
     ``I don't see what's so bad about it.''
     I drag my footsteps hither, yonder;
     ``I dread your stern regard surmising
     I drop my hero... I'll be truthful:
     I feel a brotherly affection,
     I feel a small foot in my hand;
     I find myself no longer equal;
     I find no sense; the truth is this,
     I gave my word, alas, though now
     I gave no rein to sweet affection:
     I grasp a stirrup with affection,
     I had most surely never reckoned
     I have no leisure to recall;
     I have to drag my feet to it.
     I hear the wrath of your reproach.
     I hear you say. But can you see
     I introduced my saucy Muse
     I keep them, and will quote them here:
     I kept in mind an ancient store
     I know (and seek your exculpation)

     I know it, in the thoughts of all
     I know to what malicious laughter
     I know too surely how it ends.
     I know your heart: it has a feeling
     I know, Godsent one, I'm protected
     I lack the strength required to say
     I leave the verdict in your hand.

     I like to tell the time by dinner

     I longed, like every breaker hissing,

     I love their feet -- though I confess
     I love you (what's the use to hide
     I make magnanimous confession,
     I married. I beseech you, go;
     I meant to paint, with Alban's8 glory,

     I might have seen you, heard you speak
     I move in the grand monde? that rank,
     I must translate -- there's no presuming --
     I must wake up with the conviction
     I need to rest from all this rhyme:
     I never lived or wrote for praise;
     ``I noticed once, at our chance meeting,
     I only write like this, you know,
     I own it: tender Parny's12 rhyme
     I pray God grant his soul salvation,
     I prize the attention of my friends,
     I put your genius to the test,
     I read with secret pain, and never
     I really dote upon the word:

     I roam by the secluded lake.
     I see another problem looming:
     I shall set out on brand-new ways
     I signal to each passing sail.
     I still find Gallicism delicious
     I suffered once from all the madness
     I thank him without reservation,
     ``I think I'm happy.'' Time to go,

     I was Onegin's friend that season.
     I weep, and pray for your protection..,
     ``I weep... In case there still should linger
     I would have chosen none but you
     I would have found a friend, another,
     I would have had the indiscretion
     ``I write to you -- no more confession
     I write, my heart has ceased its pining,
     I'd love you, but inside a day,
     I'd not have known you, therefore I

     I'd still like dances to this day:
     I'll catalogue each simple saying
     I'll conjure up that swooning fashion
     I'll end my tale some other time.
     I'll feed the journalists for dinner
     I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
     I'll gladden your imagination,
     I'll go, I'll go!'' -- and in a stir
     I'll just remark, my verses talk
     I'll make them spar another round,
     I'll part them, bring them back together;
     I'll save this blossom on the shoot,
     I'll say: with past ideals in view
     I'll set two ages by the ears.
     I'll sprinkle you with holy water,
     I'll stop that tempter from depraving
     I'm altering my destination
     I'm at your service to protect you;
     I'm blind to every apparition;
     I'm good for nothing now, my sweet...
     I'm grateful now with all my heart.
     I'm grieving still, but no more tears,
     I'm much afraid that bilberry wine
     I'm near to sobbing, near to weeping!...''
     I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
     I'm sick, my dear, I'm sick indeed.
     I'm terrified -- so let it be...
     I'm wandering in a world of dreams...
     I'm yours, in a predestined fashion,
     I've drawn a plan and a projection,
     ``I've dreams and years past resurrection;
     I've known too many a haughty beauty,
     I've learnt new sadness; but in this
